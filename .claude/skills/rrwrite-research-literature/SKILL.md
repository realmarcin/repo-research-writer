# Literature Research Protocol

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive literature research on the manuscript topic and generate a structured summary of:
- Background context and foundations
- Related work and competing approaches
- Recent advances and state-of-the-art
- Gaps that the manuscript addresses

## Prerequisites
**Best if you have:**
- `manuscript_plan.md` (outline with research questions)
- Draft manuscript sections (especially Introduction/Methods)
- `references.bib` (existing citations to build upon)

**Minimum requirement:**
- CLUEWRITE.md with clear research topic and key findings

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Topic Extraction
1. **Read Context Documents:**
   - Read `CLUEWRITE.md` to understand the research domain
   - Read `manuscript_plan.md` if available (for detailed topics)
   - Read `manuscript/introduction.md` or `manuscript/abstract.md` if available
   - Read `references.bib` to see what's already cited

2. **Extract Key Research Topics:**
   - Primary methodology (e.g., "transformer-based protein structure prediction")
   - Domain area (e.g., "computational biology", "deep learning")
   - Specific techniques (e.g., "attention mechanisms", "MSA features")
   - Comparison methods (e.g., "AlphaFold2", "RoseTTAFold")

3. **Formulate Search Queries:**
   Create 3-5 targeted search queries combining:
   - Core method + domain
   - Technique + application
   - "Recent advances in [topic]"
   - "State of the art [domain]"
   - Each competing method mentioned

### Phase 2: Literature Search

**Use WebSearch tool to find:**
1. **Foundational Papers** (highly cited, >1000 citations)
   - Query: "[core method] review" OR "[domain] survey"
   - Focus on papers from last 5 years for reviews, last 10 for foundations

2. **Recent Advances** (last 2 years, 2024-2026)
   - Query: "[method] 2024" OR "[method] 2025" OR "[method] 2026"
   - Look for: NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, Nature, Science papers

3. **Direct Competitors** (methods you're comparing against)
   - Query: exact names of competing methods
   - Find their original papers and recent improvements

4. **Application Domain** (specific to your problem)
   - Query: "[your application] + [your method type]"
   - Example: "protein structure prediction transformers"

**For each relevant paper found:**
- Extract: Authors, Title, Venue, Year, **DOI** (critical!)
- Note: Key contribution, methodology, results
- Record: Citation key format (e.g., author2024)
- **Capture direct quote**: Extract 1-2 sentences that best represent the key finding or contribution

### Phase 3: Synthesis

Generate a structured summary in `manuscript/literature.md`:

```markdown

## References to Add to references.bib

[Provide properly formatted BibTeX entries for all cited works]

```

### Phase 4: Citation File Generation

Create or update `bib_additions.bib` with BibTeX entries for all newly found papers:

```bibtex
@article{author2024,
  title={Title of Paper},
  author={Author, First and Author, Second},
  journal={Journal/Conference},
  year={2024},
  doi={10.1234/journal.2024.12345},
  url={https://doi.org/10.1234/journal.2024.12345}
}
```

**CRITICAL**: Always include DOI when available. DOIs are permanent identifiers and essential for verification.

### Phase 5: Evidence Documentation

Create `literature_evidence.csv` with columns:

```csv
doi,citation_key,evidence
10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2,jumper2021,"We developed AlphaFold, a deep learning system that predicts protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known."
10.1126/science.abj8754,baek2021,"RoseTTAFold can generate accurate models of protein structures and complexes using as input only a protein sequence."
10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1057,author2024,"Our approach achieves 15% improvement over existing methods while reducing computational cost by 3-fold."
```

**Requirements for evidence quotes:**
- Extract 1-2 sentences that capture the KEY finding or contribution
- Use direct quotes (verbatim from the paper)
- Focus on quantitative results or novel methodological claims
- Ensure quote is self-contained and understandable
- Include page number in comment if possible

## Output Files

Generate **three files** in the `manuscript/` directory (per schema: schemas/manuscript.yaml):

1. **`manuscript/literature.md`**
   - One-page structured summary (800-1000 words)
   - Organized by themes, not chronologically
   - Includes citation keys in [author2024] format
   - **Each citation includes DOI**: e.g., [jumper2021, DOI:10.1038/...]
   - Required sections: Background, Related Work, Recent Advances, Research Gaps

2. **`manuscript/literature_citations.bib`**
   - BibTeX entries for all newly found references
   - **Must include DOI field** for each entry
   - Ready to append to existing references.bib

3. **`manuscript/literature_evidence.csv`**
   - **Three columns**: doi, citation_key, evidence
   - Direct quotes from each cited paper
   - Enables verification and evidence chains
   - Can be used to check claims against original sources

## Validation

After generating files, validate the literature review:
```bash
python scripts/rrwrite-validate-manuscript.py --file manuscript/literature.md --type literature
```

If validation passes, confirm completion. If it fails, fix issues and re-validate.

```

## Evidence File Example

`literature_evidence.csv`:
```csv
doi,citation_key,evidence
10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2,jumper2021,"We developed AlphaFold, a deep learning system that predicts protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. AlphaFold achieved a median accuracy of 92.4 GDT on CASP14 targets."
10.1126/science.abj8754,baek2021,"RoseTTAFold can generate accurate models of protein structures and complexes using as input only a protein sequence. The method achieves accuracy comparable to AlphaFold while being more computationally efficient."
10.1038/s41467-024-12345-6,yang2024,"We demonstrate that pre-trained protein language models can reduce MSA requirements by 80% while maintaining prediction accuracy above 85% on CASP15 targets."
arXiv:2401.12345,zhang2025,"Our efficient transformer architecture achieves real-time protein structure prediction (< 1 second per protein) with only 5% accuracy loss compared to AlphaFold2."
```

**Using the evidence file:**
- Cross-reference claims in your manuscript with direct quotes
- Verify that your interpretation aligns with original sources
- Provide evidence for peer reviewers if challenged
- Enable reproducible claim verification

## Limitations & Handling

**If no manuscript outline exists:**
- Use CLUEWRITE.md "Key Findings" to infer topics
- Focus on broader domain literature
- Request user clarification on specific sub-topics

**If references.bib already extensive:**
- Compare found papers with existing citations
- Flag papers that should be added
- Suggest papers that might be outdated or less relevant

**If topic is very niche:**
- Expand search to broader domain
- Include methodological foundations even if not domain-specific
- Flag if insufficient literature found (suggest broadening)

## Notes

- **DO NOT hallucinate papers** - Only cite papers found via WebSearch or in references.bib
- **Verify all citations** - Double-check author names, years, venues
- **Always capture DOIs** - Essential for permanent identification and verification
- **Extract exact quotes** - Copy verbatim from paper abstract or results, no paraphrasing
- **Be selective** - Quality over quantity; cite only the most relevant papers
- **Stay current** - Prioritize papers from last 2-3 years for "Recent Advances"
- **Cross-reference** - If a paper cites another relevant paper, follow the trail
- **Use WebFetch if needed** - To read paper abstracts and extract accurate quotes
- **Format evidence properly** - Ensure CSV is properly escaped (quotes within quotes)
