## Background & Foundations

### Reproducible Research and Computational Workflows

The foundation of automated manuscript generation lies in reproducible computational research. Computational research relies on well-structured workflows that bundle executable code with documentation and output [FAIR4RS, DOI:10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x]. The FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) were established in 2016 to improve scientific data management [Wilkinson2016, DOI:10.1038/sdata.2016.18], later adapted specifically for research software through FAIR4RS principles recognizing that software requires distinct guidelines from data [Barker2022].

Reproducible computational science requires four pillars: capture of code and environment, declarative workflows, verifiable provenance, and complete reporting [HasLer2024]. Workflow provenance describes the structure, control logic, and execution details, capturing metadata about what was done, when, where, how, and by whom [LLMProvenance2025]. Scientific research has struggled with reproducibility due to low data sharing rates and lack of provenance tracking [JMIR2024, DOI:10.2196/51297].

### Jupyter Notebooks as Publication Format

Jupyter notebooks facilitate bundling executable code with documentation and output in interactive environments, representing a popular mechanism to document and share computational workflows [Kluyver2016]. The "Notebooks Now!" project developed an end-to-end workflow for submission, peer review, and publication of computational notebooks as the primary element of the scientific record [Caprarelli2023, DOI:10.1029/2023EA003458]. However, reproducibility challenges persist as the majority of published notebooks cannot be executed automatically due to inadequate dependency documentation [Pimentel2023, DOI:10.1093/gigascience/giad113].

## Related Work

### Approach A: Traditional Manuscript Automation Systems

**Key Papers:** [Himmelstein2019, DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128]

**Methodology:** Manubot modernizes publishing by making it transparent, reproducible, immediate, versioned, collaborative, and free of charge. Manuscripts are written in Markdown and stored in Git repositories to track changes precisely, with repositories hosted publicly on platforms like GitHub. Manubot automates bibliography creation and manuscript deployment as webpages, supporting citations via persistent identifiers (DOI, PMID) directly in text. Continuous publication via Travis CI automatically reflects source updates in online outputs.

**Strengths:** Proven collaborative writing model, excellent version control, automated citation management, open-source and widely adopted.

**Limitations:** Requires manual content creation, no automated fact verification against data files, limited repository analysis capabilities, no journal-specific formatting automation.

### Approach B: Reproducible Document Generation

**Key Papers:** [Curvenote2024], [Quarto2024]

**Methodology:** Quarto is an open-source scientific publishing system compatible with Jupyter Notebooks and plain text markdown. It creates reproducible documents that can be regenerated when underlying assumptions or data change, embedding code and data within documents to populate tables, figures, and statistics automatically. A reproducible manuscript workflow with Quarto templates enables standardized methods that are more reproducible, efficient, and transparent than standard office tools [USGS2024, DOI:10.3996/JFWM-24-005].

**Strengths:** Strong integration with computational notebooks, automatic figure/table generation, multi-format output (HTML, PDF, DOCX), active development and community support.

**Limitations:** Still requires manual narrative writing, no automated literature review, limited fact-checking automation, no adversarial critique system.

### Approach C: Code-to-Publication Transformation

**Key Papers:** [Seo2025, arXiv:2504.17192]

**Methodology:** PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework, transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories through three stages: planning (constructing roadmaps, designing architecture), analysis (interpreting implementation details), and generation (producing modular, dependency-aware code). This represents the inverse problem of RRWrite—converting papers to code rather than code to papers.

**Strengths:** Multi-agent orchestration, 77% of generated repositories rated best by human judges, addresses the reproducibility gap (only 21.23% of top-tier ML papers in 2024 provide code).

**Limitations:** Operates in reverse direction (paper→code not code→paper), no manuscript generation capabilities, focused on ML domain specifically.

### Approach D: Workflow Management Systems

**Key Papers:** [Nextflow2024, DOI:10.1186/s13059-025-03673-9], [Snakemake2024]

**Methodology:** Scientific workflow management systems like Nextflow and Snakemake automate complex computational pipelines. Nextflow experienced highest growth in usage between 2021-2024, accounting for 24.1% of WorkflowHub entries. These systems provide workflow provenance, reproducibility, and automation but focus on data processing rather than manuscript generation.

**Strengths:** Mature ecosystem, scalable execution, provenance tracking, broad adoption in bioinformatics.

**Limitations:** No manuscript writing capabilities, require separate documentation effort, focused on computation not communication.

## Recent Advances

### AI-Powered Academic Writing Assistants

Recent work demonstrates AI integration reshaping academic writing workflows. Research reveals a U-shaped impact of scaffolding on writing quality, where high scaffolding significantly improved productivity, especially for non-regular writers [CHI2024, DOI:10.1145/3613904.3642134]. However, challenges persist: frequently reported issues include factual inaccuracies, fabricated references, and biases in large language models [Ros2025, DOI:10.1002/ace.70014; Frontiers2025, DOI:10.3389/feduc.2025.1711718].

### Automated Fact-Checking and Claim Verification

Scientific claim verification has advanced significantly in 2024-2025. CliVER, an end-to-end clinical claim verification system, leverages retrieval-augmented techniques to retrieve relevant abstracts and use the PICO framework to support or refute claims [CliVER2024, DOI:10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae021]. Climinator achieved 96% binary classification accuracy verifying climate claims by integrating authoritative sources within a debating framework [Climinator2025, DOI:10.1038/s44168-025-00215-8]. Research on data claims verification presented at UIST 2024 addresses verification of statistical and numeric claims derived from structured data [UIST2024].

### Literature Review Automation

AI-assisted screening for systematic reviews achieved 85% accuracy while reducing review time by approximately 40% [Khalil2024, DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1731]. Tools like Elicit, Rayyan, and SWIFT-Active Screener automate literature screening, deduplication, and data extraction. Platforms typically generate properly formatted citations automatically from paper metadata, integrating with reference management software like Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote.

### Schema Validation and Data Modeling

LinkML (Linked Data Modeling Language) provides an open framework for data modeling from schema creation to validation and integration. The ISMB 2024 tutorial demonstrated LinkML's capabilities for developing models and validating them with test data [LinkML2024]. LinkML facilitates structured, standardized scientific data, addressing challenges of interoperability, validation, and reuse.

## Research Gaps

**Identified Gaps:**

1. **Integrated Workflow Gap:** Existing tools address individual components (citation management, workflow execution, document generation) but no system integrates repository analysis, fact verification, literature research, and journal-specific formatting into a single automated workflow.

2. **Provenance Verification Gap:** While provenance tracking exists for workflows, no system connects numerical claims in manuscripts directly back to source data files with automated verification.

3. **Adversarial Quality Control Gap:** Current AI writing tools lack systematic critique mechanisms that evaluate manuscripts against journal standards and provide actionable revision guidance.

4. **Version Management Gap:** Tools support either Git versioning or workflow state tracking, but not hybrid approaches that combine collaboration (Git) with iterative refinement cycles (semantic versioning for critique iterations).

**How Our Work Fits:**

RRWrite addresses all four gaps by providing an end-to-end system that: (1) integrates repository analysis through manuscript critique in a single workflow, (2) enforces fact-checking via Python verification scripts that validate claims against CSV/Excel data, (3) implements adversarial critique using journal-specific evaluation criteria, and (4) introduces hybrid versioning combining Git collaboration with state-tracked workflow progress and semantic versioning for manuscript iterations.
