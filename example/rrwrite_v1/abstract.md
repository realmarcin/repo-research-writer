# Abstract

**Motivation:** Scientific manuscript generation from research repositories is labor-intensive, requiring manual code analysis, literature review, and journal-specific formatting. Existing writing assistants lack domain knowledge and structured validation, leading to citation errors and formatting inconsistencies.

**Results:** RRWrite is an AI-powered tool that transforms research repositories into publication-ready manuscripts through a structured 7-phase workflow. The system performs deep repository analysis (code, data, documentation extraction), automated literature search with cascading year strategy (Tier 1: 2024-2026, Tier 2: 2020-2023, Tier 3: foundational reviews), and multi-phase drafting with defense-in-depth citation validation. Implementation comprises 9 specialized workflow skills (analyze, plan, research, draft, assemble, critique), 30 Python scripts for evidence extraction and validation, and a 4-layer validation framework (entry, business logic, assembly, audit) that structurally prevents citation errors. Analysis of the RRWrite repository itself demonstrates practical capability: 142 files analyzed (85 documentation, 35 scripts, 21 data files), 7 research topics identified with confidence scoring, and complete manuscript generation with journal-specific formatting for Nature, Bioinformatics, and PLOS. The tool integrates Git-safe version control, LinkML schema validation, and verification gates at each workflow phase.

**Availability:** Open-source at https://github.com/realmarcin/repo-research-writer under MIT license. Requires Python 3.8+ and Claude Code CLI for skill integration.
