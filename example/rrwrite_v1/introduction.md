# Introduction

## The Manuscript Generation Challenge

Converting research code and data into publishable scientific manuscripts is a time-intensive, error-prone bottleneck in computational research. Researchers face multiple barriers: manual extraction of methods and results from code repositories, time-consuming literature searches and citation management, adapting manuscripts to different journal formats (Nature vs. PLOS vs. Bioinformatics), and ensuring citation integrity with proper evidence tracking. Existing general writing assistants like Grammarly and Overleaf provide grammar checking and LaTeX formatting but lack domain-specific knowledge for scientific content generation. Academic writing tools focus on bibliography management (Zotero, Mendeley) or formatting (LaTeX editors) but do not generate content from research repositories. The result is a manual, weeks-long process to transform computational work into publication-ready manuscripts, delaying dissemination and consuming researcher time that could be spent on scientific inquiry.

## Current Gaps in Automated Manuscript Generation

No existing tools bridge the gap from research repository to manuscript through automated analysis and drafting. While large language models like ChatGPT and Claude can assist with text generation, they lack structured workflows for scientific manuscripts, validation frameworks for citation integrity, and integration with version control systems. Citation management remains manual, leading to bibliography errors and orphaned references. Tools generate manuscripts in generic formats, requiring subsequent reformatting for specific journals—a wasteful duplication of effort. Most critically, AI writing assistants operate without verification gates, allowing incomplete sections, unsupported claims, and citation errors to propagate through the manuscript. The scientific community lacks an open-source, workflow-driven tool that combines repository analysis, literature search, evidence-based drafting, and multi-layer validation into a single pipeline.

## RRWrite: An Integrated Repository-to-Manuscript Tool

RRWrite addresses these gaps as the first tool integrating repository analysis, automated literature search, structured multi-phase drafting, and defense-in-depth validation for scientific manuscripts. The system architecture comprises nine specialized skills (analyze repository, plan manuscript, research literature, draft sections, assemble manuscript, critique content and format) implemented through 35 Python scripts totaling 142 files analyzed in this codebase. The workflow executes seven phases with verification gates: repository analysis extracts file structure and research topics; outline planning maps evidence to sections; cascading literature search prioritizes recent work (2024-2026) while ensuring comprehensive coverage through intelligent fallback to foundational papers (2020-2023, then 2016-2019); section drafting follows journal-specific templates with word count enforcement; assembly synchronizes citations with bibliography; and two-stage critique validates content accuracy and format compliance. Defense-in-depth citation validation operates at four layers (entry validation during drafting, business logic checking for section appropriateness, assembly-time completeness verification, and audit trail forensics), structurally preventing the citation errors that plague manual workflows. RRWrite targets three major journal formats (Nature, Bioinformatics, PLOS) with configurable word limits and section structures, generating publication-ready manuscripts from repository analysis in 40-80 minutes.
