# Data and Code Availability

The complete RRWrite system, including all four integrated skills, verification scripts, and configuration templates, is freely available as open source software under the MIT License. The source code repository is hosted at https://github.com/realmarcin/repo-research-writer. Installation requires a single command (`./install.sh`) that creates symbolic links to the global Claude Code skills directory. Complete documentation is provided in README.md, INSTALL.md, and USAGE_GUIDE.md. A reference implementation demonstrating self-documentation capabilities is included in `examples/repo-research-writer_v1/`, containing the full manuscript generated by RRWrite analyzing its own codebase, including outline, all sections, literature evidence with DOI citations, and critique assessment.
