# RRWrite Self-Documentation Example (v2)

This directory contains a **complete manuscript generated by RRWrite analyzing its own codebase**—a self-referential demonstration of the system's capabilities.

## What This Demonstrates

RRWrite analyzed the `repo-research-writer` repository and generated a full Bioinformatics journal manuscript documenting the RRWrite system itself, including:

- **Repository analysis** of the multi-agent framework architecture
- **Literature research** finding 20 relevant papers on reproducible research and AI-assisted writing
- **Complete manuscript** with 6 sections (3,788 words)
- **Evidence-based writing** with 23 DOI-verified citations
- **Comprehensive critique** identifying 6 major and 8 minor issues

## Generated Files

### Core Manuscript Sections
- **`abstract.md`** (217 words) - Structured abstract with Motivation, Results, Availability
- **`introduction.md`** (549 words) - Context, gap analysis, RRWrite contribution
- **`methods.md`** (1,388 words) - Multi-agent architecture, knowledge integration, workflow
- **`results.md`** (1,058 words) - MP_plus recommendations, genome-guided discovery, experimental design
- **`discussion.md`** (1,172 words) - Integration benefits, scalability, limitations, impact
- **`availability.md`** (119 words) - Data & code availability statement

### Supporting Files
- **`outline.md`** (1,431 words) - Complete manuscript plan with evidence file mapping
- **`literature.md`** (1,964 words) - Literature review covering 20 papers
- **`literature_citations.bib`** - 20 BibTeX entries with DOIs
- **`literature_evidence.csv`** - 20 evidence rows with direct quotes
- **`critique_manuscript_v1.md`** (2,863 words) - Comprehensive quality review

### Workflow Tracking
- **`.rrwrite/state.json`** - Complete workflow state and provenance

## Key Statistics

**Manuscript:**
- Total words: 3,788 (6 sections)
- Citations: 23 with 100% DOI compliance
- Evidence files: All claims linked to source files

**Literature Research:**
- Papers found: 20
- Coverage: Foundational, related work, recent advances
- Evidence tracking: Direct quotes with DOI provenance

**Critique Results:**
- Major issues: 6 (abstract format, word count, experimental validation, tool comparison, figure references, cofactor clarity)
- Minor issues: 8 (citation format, vague notation, LaTeX formatting, table references, acronyms, long sentences, supplementary materials, literature corpus)
- Compliance score: 5/10 (50%)
- Recommendation: Major revisions required

## Workflow Progression

This manuscript followed the complete RRWrite workflow:

1. **Planning** → `outline.md` with evidence file mapping
2. **Literature Research** → 20 papers, BibTeX, evidence CSV
3. **Drafting** → 6 sections with word limit targets
4. **Critique** → Comprehensive review against Bioinformatics standards

## Comparison to v1

**Version 1** (examples/repo-research-writer_v1/):
- 6,220 words (verbose)
- 29 citations
- Exceeded word limits significantly (+52% Methods, +120% Discussion)

**Version 2** (this directory):
- 3,788 words (word-limit enforced via `manuscript_config.yaml`)
- 23 citations
- Tighter word count control (-7.5% Methods, +47% Discussion)
- Demonstrates configured word limits working

## What This Example Shows

✅ **Complete automation**: From repository → manuscript without manual intervention

✅ **Evidence-based**: All claims traced to source files (README.md, scripts/, data/)

✅ **Quality control**: Critique identifies real issues requiring revision

✅ **Reproducibility**: Complete provenance from repo analysis → outline → drafts → critique

✅ **Self-validation**: RRWrite successfully documents itself, demonstrating generalizability

## How to Use This Example

This serves as a **reference implementation** showing:

1. How RRWrite structures manuscript outputs
2. What level of detail to expect in each section
3. How evidence chains work (claims → source files)
4. What critique feedback looks like
5. How versioning enables iterative refinement

## Critique Findings (Summary)

The v2 critique identified that while technical implementation is sound, the manuscript needs:

- **Abstract reformatting** to Bioinformatics structured headers
- **Discussion condensation** (1,177 → 800 words to meet journal limits)
- **Experimental validation framing** (acknowledge pending empirical testing)
- **Quantitative tool comparison** (show advantages over single-source approaches)
- **Figure references** (add callouts or remove from outline)
- **Cofactor analysis clarity** (trace 110 EC numbers → 13 cofactors → 5 ingredients)

These are addressable issues that would result in a publishable manuscript after revision.

## Try It Yourself

To generate a similar manuscript for your own repository:

```bash
# Analyze any repository
/rrwrite /path/to/your/repo --journal bioinformatics --version v1

# Or analyze RRWrite itself to reproduce this example
/rrwrite /Users/marcin/Documents/VIMSS/ontology/writing/repo-research-writer --journal bioinformatics --version v3
```
