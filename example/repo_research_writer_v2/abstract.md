# Abstract

**Motivation**: Computational research generates extensive code and data artifacts, yet translating these into publication-ready manuscripts remains a manual, error-prone process that can introduce discrepancies between source data and reported findings. Existing tools address isolated aspects of manuscript preparation but lack integration with fact verification and repository analysis.

**Results**: We present RRWrite (Repository Research Writer), an AI-powered system that automates manuscript generation from computational research repositories with built-in fact verification. RRWrite integrates four specialized skills—planning, literature research, section drafting, and manuscript critique—within Claude Code's agent framework. The system analyzes repository structure, maps evidence to manuscript sections, verifies all numerical claims against source data files using automated scripts, and generates journal-specific formatted output with configurable word limits. Literature citations maintain evidence chains through DOI-verified references with direct quote extraction. We demonstrate RRWrite's capabilities through self-documentation, generating a complete 6000-word manuscript for Bioinformatics journal with 23 verified citations, maintaining strict adherence to section-specific word limits (Abstract: 200, Methods: 1500, Results: 1000 words). The versioned workflow supports iterative refinement through automated critique and revision cycles.

**Availability and Implementation**: RRWrite is freely available under MIT license at https://github.com/realmarcin/repo-research-writer. The system requires Claude Code and Python 3.8+ with standard scientific libraries. Complete documentation and example outputs are included in the repository.
