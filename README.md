# Repo Research Writer (RRWrite) 📝

**Transform your research code into publication-ready manuscripts automatically.**

Repo Research Writer (RRWrite) is an AI-powered system that reads your research repository—code, data, and notebooks—and generates scientifically accurate manuscripts with verified facts, proper citations, and journal-specific formatting.

## 🎯 What RRWrite Does

Instead of manually translating your computational research into text:

```
Your Research Repo            RRWrite              Publication
├── data/results.csv    ──────────────────>    ┌─────────────────┐
├── scripts/analyze.py  ──────────────────>    │ Abstract        │
├── figures/fig1.png    ──────────────────>    │ Introduction    │
└── notebooks/          ──────────────────>    │ Methods         │
                                                │ Results         │
                                                │ Discussion      │
                                                └─────────────────┘
```

RRWrite:
- ✅ **Extracts findings** from your data files
- ✅ **Verifies all numbers** against source CSVs
- ✅ **Describes methods** by reading your code
- ✅ **Formats for journals** (Nature, PLOS, Bioinformatics)
- ✅ **Maintains evidence chains** from data to claims

## 🚀 Quick Example

See a real example: [example/](example/) - A complete protein structure prediction project

```bash
# In your research project directory
cd my-research-project

# Step 1: Use RRWrite to analyze your repository
# No PROJECT.md needed - analyzes repo automatically!

# Step 2: Plan the manuscript
"Use /rrwrite-plan-manuscript to create an outline for Bioinformatics journal"

# Step 3: Research the literature
"Use /rrwrite-research-literature to find relevant background papers and related work"

# Step 3: Draft sections
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the Methods section"
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the Results section"

# Step 4: Critique for compliance
"Use /rrwrite-critique-manuscript to check the draft"
```

**Result**: A complete manuscript draft where every claim is traced back to your source data.

## 📊 Real-World Example

The `example/` directory contains a complete demonstration:

**Input**: Protein prediction project with:
- CSV data: `benchmark_results.csv` (model accuracies)
- Python scripts: `train_model.py`, `evaluate.py`
- Figures: `accuracy_comparison.png`
- BibTeX: `references.bib`

**RRWrite Output**:
- Detailed manuscript plan mapping data→sections
- Methods section describing the code implementation
- Results section with verified statistics
- Proper figure captions derived from plotting code
- Journal-compliant formatting for Bioinformatics

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone RRWrite to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/realmarcin/repo-research-writer.git ~/repo-research-writer

# 2. Install globally
cd ~/repo-research-writer
./install.sh

# That's it! RRWrite is now available globally.
```

### What install.sh Does

- Creates `~/.claude/skills/` directory
- Creates **symbolic links** pointing to RRWrite skills:
  ```
  ~/.claude/skills/rrwrite-plan-manuscript
  ~/.claude/skills/rrwrite-draft-section
  ~/.claude/skills/rrwrite-research-literature
  ~/.claude/skills/rrwrite-critique-manuscript
  ```
- **Benefit**: Update RRWrite once (`git pull`), all projects get updates automatically

### New Architecture: External Repository Model

RRWrite now works with **external repositories** - you don't install it into your research projects!

```bash
# Analyze any repository (GitHub URL or local path)
/rrwrite https://github.com/user/research-project --journal bioinformatics

# Or analyze a local directory
/rrwrite /path/to/my-research --journal nature

# Or the current directory
/rrwrite . --journal plos
```

All manuscripts are generated in versioned directories within RRWrite:
```
~/repo-research-writer/
├── manuscript/
│   ├── my-research_v1/    # First iteration
│   ├── my-research_v2/    # After critique
│   └── my-research_v3/    # Final version
└── examples/
    └── repo-research-writer_v1/  # Reference example
```

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Repository Ingestion

RRWrite reads your project structure:
```
your-project/
├── data/processed/results.csv    → Numerical evidence
├── scripts/analyze.py             → Methodology
├── figures/fig1.png              → Visual results
└── PROJECT.md                      → Key findings summary
```

### 2. Planning

The `/rrwrite-plan-manuscript` skill creates a detailed outline:
- Maps each section to specific files
- Links claims to data sources
- Applies journal-specific structure

### 3. Drafting with Verification

The `/rrwrite-draft-section` skill:
- Reads relevant code/data files
- Generates academic prose
- **Verifies every number** using `rrwrite-verify-stats.py`
- Cites from your `references.bib`

Example fact-checking:
```bash
# Agent writes: "The model achieved 87% accuracy"
# Behind the scenes:
python scripts/rrwrite-verify-stats.py --file data/results.csv --col accuracy --op mean
# Returns: 0.87 ✓
```

### 4. Critique

The `/rrwrite-critique-manuscript` skill acts as "Reviewer #2":
- Checks journal-specific requirements
- Verifies citation integrity
- Flags missing figures or data availability statements

## 🛠️ Verification Tools

RRWrite includes Python tools to ensure accuracy:

### `rrwrite-verify-stats.py`
Verifies numerical claims against source data:
```bash
python scripts/rrwrite-verify-stats.py \
  --file data/results.csv \
  --col accuracy \
  --op mean
# Output: 0.8734
```

### `rrwrite-clean-ipynb.py`
Converts Jupyter notebooks to clean markdown:
```bash
python scripts/rrwrite-clean-ipynb.py notebook.ipynb -o clean.md
# Removes base64 images, keeps code and markdown
```

### `rrwrite-validate-manuscript.py`
Validates manuscript outputs against LinkML schema:
```bash
# Validate outline
python scripts/rrwrite-validate-manuscript.py \
  --file manuscript/outline.md \
  --type outline

# Validate section
python scripts/rrwrite-validate-manuscript.py \
  --file manuscript/methods.md \
  --type section

# Validate full manuscript
python scripts/rrwrite-validate-manuscript.py \
  --file manuscript/full_manuscript.md \
  --type manuscript
```

### `rrwrite-assemble-manuscript.py`
Assembles individual sections into full manuscript:
```bash
python scripts/rrwrite-assemble-manuscript.py
# Creates manuscript/full_manuscript.md from sections
```

## 📋 Schema-Based Validation

All manuscript outputs follow a LinkML schema (`schemas/manuscript.yaml`) that ensures:

- ✅ **Correct filenames**: `outline.md`, `literature.md`, `abstract.md`, etc.
- ✅ **Required sections**: All necessary parts included
- ✅ **Word count targets**: Sections meet minimum lengths
- ✅ **Citation integrity**: Proper citation format
- ✅ **Critique versioning**: `critique_TYPE_v1.md`, `critique_TYPE_v2.md`, etc.

Skills automatically validate outputs after generation. See [MANUSCRIPT_SCHEMA.md](MANUSCRIPT_SCHEMA.md) for details.

## 📚 Example Outputs

### From PROJECT.md:
```markdown
## Key Finding
Our model achieves 87% accuracy on the benchmark.

Evidence: data/results.csv (line 45), figures/accuracy.png
```

### Generated Methods Section:
```markdown
## Methods

The model was trained using AdamW optimizer (learning rate 1e-4,
weight decay 0.01) for 100 epochs on 4× NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The loss
function combined RMSD and TM-score as implemented in
`scripts/train_model.py:87-89`.
```

### With Verification:
```python
# The agent reads train_model.py and finds:
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-4,          # ← Extracted
    weight_decay=0.01  # ← Extracted
)
```
