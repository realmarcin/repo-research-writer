# ClueWrite 📝

**Transform your research code into publication-ready manuscripts automatically.**

ClueWrite is an AI-powered system that reads your research repository—code, data, and notebooks—and generates scientifically accurate manuscripts with verified facts, proper citations, and journal-specific formatting.

## 🎯 What ClueWrite Does

Instead of manually translating your computational research into text:

```
Your Research Repo          ClueWrite              Publication
├── data/results.csv    ──────────────────>    ┌─────────────────┐
├── scripts/analyze.py  ──────────────────>    │ Abstract        │
├── figures/fig1.png    ──────────────────>    │ Introduction    │
└── notebooks/          ──────────────────>    │ Methods         │
                                                │ Results         │
                                                │ Discussion      │
                                                └─────────────────┘
```

ClueWrite:
- ✅ **Extracts findings** from your data files
- ✅ **Verifies all numbers** against source CSVs
- ✅ **Describes methods** by reading your code
- ✅ **Formats for journals** (Nature, PLOS, Bioinformatics)
- ✅ **Maintains evidence chains** from data to claims

## 🚀 Quick Example

See a real example: [example/](example/) - A complete protein structure prediction project

```bash
# In your research project directory
cd my-research-project

# Step 1: Tell ClueWrite about your project
# Edit CLUEWRITE.md with your findings and data sources

# Step 2: Plan the manuscript
"Use cluewrite-plan-manuscript to create an outline for Bioinformatics journal"

# Step 3: Research the literature
"Use cluewrite-research-literature to find relevant background papers and related work"

# Step 3: Draft sections
"Use cluewrite-draft-section to write the Methods section"
"Use cluewrite-draft-section to write the Results section"

# Step 4: Review for compliance
"Use cluewrite-review-manuscript to check the draft"
```

**Result**: A complete manuscript draft where every claim is traced back to your source data.

## 📊 Real-World Example

The `example/` directory contains a complete demonstration:

**Input**: Protein prediction project with:
- CSV data: `benchmark_results.csv` (model accuracies)
- Python scripts: `train_model.py`, `evaluate.py`
- Figures: `accuracy_comparison.png`
- BibTeX: `references.bib`

**ClueWrite Output**:
- Detailed manuscript plan mapping data→sections
- Methods section describing the code implementation
- Results section with verified statistics
- Proper figure captions derived from plotting code
- Journal-compliant formatting for Bioinformatics

## 🔧 Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended - Use Across All Projects)

```bash
# 1. Clone ClueWrite to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/realmarcin/cluewrite.git ~/cluewrite
# Note: You can clone anywhere, just remember the path!

# 2. Install globally
cd ~/cluewrite
./install.sh global

# 3. Setup any research project
cd /path/to/your/research/project
~/cluewrite/install.sh setup-project
```

**If you cloned to a different location:**
```bash
# Replace ~/cluewrite with your actual path
cd /your/actual/path/to/cluewrite
./install.sh global

# Then use the full path when setting up projects
cd /path/to/your/research/project
/your/actual/path/to/cluewrite/install.sh setup-project
```

### What install.sh Does

#### `./install.sh global`
- Creates `~/.claude/skills/` directory
- Creates **symbolic links** (not copies) pointing to ClueWrite skills:
  ```
  ~/.claude/skills/cluewrite-plan-manuscript → /path/to/cluewrite/.claude/skills/cluewrite-plan-manuscript
  ~/.claude/skills/cluewrite-draft-section → /path/to/cluewrite/.claude/skills/cluewrite-draft-section
  ~/.claude/skills/cluewrite-review-manuscript → /path/to/cluewrite/.claude/skills/cluewrite-review-manuscript
  ```
- **Benefit**: Update ClueWrite once (`git pull`), all projects get updates automatically

#### `./install.sh setup-project`
Prepares your research project by:
1. Creating directory structure (`cluewrite-drafts/`, `scripts/`, `figures/`, `data/`)
2. Copying `CLUEWRITE.md` template for documenting findings
3. Copying verification tools (`cluewrite-verify-stats.py`, `cluewrite-clean-ipynb.py`)
4. Creating `.gitignore` for manuscript drafts

#### `./install.sh local`
- Copies (not symlinks) skills directly to current project's `.claude/skills/`
- Use when you want project-specific skill customization
- Updates require re-copying to each project

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Repository Ingestion

ClueWrite reads your project structure:
```
your-project/
├── data/processed/results.csv    → Numerical evidence
├── scripts/analyze.py             → Methodology
├── figures/fig1.png              → Visual results
└── CLUEWRITE.md                    → Key findings summary
```

### 2. Planning

The `cluewrite-plan-manuscript` skill creates a detailed outline:
- Maps each section to specific files
- Links claims to data sources
- Applies journal-specific structure

### 3. Drafting with Verification

The `cluewrite-draft-section` skill:
- Reads relevant code/data files
- Generates academic prose
- **Verifies every number** using `cluewrite-verify-stats.py`
- Cites from your `references.bib`

Example fact-checking:
```bash
# Agent writes: "The model achieved 87% accuracy"
# Behind the scenes:
python scripts/cluewrite-verify-stats.py --file data/results.csv --col accuracy --op mean
# Returns: 0.87 ✓
```

## 🛠️ Verification Tools

ClueWrite includes Python tools to ensure accuracy:

### `cluewrite-verify-stats.py`
Verifies numerical claims against source data:
```bash
python scripts/cluewrite-verify-stats.py \
  --file data/results.csv \
  --col accuracy \
  --op mean
# Output: 0.8734
```

### `cluewrite-clean-ipynb.py`
Converts Jupyter notebooks to clean markdown:
```bash
python scripts/cluewrite-clean-ipynb.py notebook.ipynb -o clean.md
# Removes base64 images, keeps code and markdown
```

```

## 💡 Key Features

### ✅ Fact-Checking
Every numerical claim is verified against source data files.

### ✅ Code→Text Consistency
Variable names in the code match those in the manuscript.

### ✅ Evidence Chains
Each claim links to specific files/line numbers.

### ✅ Journal Compliance
Automatic formatting for target journals.

### ✅ Reproducibility
Complete provenance from data to publication.

## 📚 Example Outputs

### From CLUEWRITE.md:
```markdown
## Key Finding
Our model achieves 87% accuracy on the benchmark.

Evidence: data/results.csv (line 45), figures/accuracy.png
```

### Generated Methods Section:
```markdown
## Methods

The model was trained using AdamW optimizer (learning rate 1e-4,
weight decay 0.01) for 100 epochs on 4× NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The loss
function combined RMSD and TM-score as implemented in
`scripts/train_model.py:87-89`.
```

### With Verification:
```python
# The agent reads train_model.py and finds:
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=1e-4,          # ← Extracted
    weight_decay=0.01  # ← Extracted
)
```

## 🔍 Installation Troubleshooting

**"Skills not found"?**
- Check if skills are linked: `ls -la ~/.claude/skills/`
- Verify symlinks point to correct location: `readlink ~/.claude/skills/cluewrite-plan-manuscript`
- If path is wrong, re-run: `./install.sh global` from the correct ClueWrite directory

**"Can't find install.sh"?**
- Make sure you're in the ClueWrite repository directory
- Check: `pwd` should show the path where you cloned ClueWrite
- The directory should contain: `.claude/`, `scripts/`, `README.md`, `install.sh`

**Want to move ClueWrite?**
```bash
# If you move the repo, re-run global install
cd /new/location/of/cluewrite
./install.sh global
# This will update the symlinks
```
