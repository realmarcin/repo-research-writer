# Repo Research Writer (RRWrite) Workflow Guide

Complete step-by-step workflow for generating a scientific manuscript from your research repository.

## 🎯 Overview

```
Research Repository → Manuscript Outline → Literature Review → Draft Sections → Review & Revise → Publication
```

## 📋 Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

**Goal**: Set up your project structure and document your findings.

#### Step 1.1: Install RRWrite (One-time)
```bash
cd /path/to/repo-research-writer
./install.sh global
```

#### Step 1.2: Setup Your Research Project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/research/project
/path/to/repo-research-writer/install.sh setup-project
```

**Creates:**
- `CLUEWRITE.md` (template)
- `rrwrite-drafts/`, `scripts/`, `figures/`, `data/` directories
- Verification scripts

#### Step 1.3: Document Your Findings
Edit `CLUEWRITE.md` with:
- Project overview and goals
- Target journal
- Key findings with evidence links (data files, scripts, figures)
- Methodology notes

**Example:**
```markdown
# My Research Project

## Key Findings
1. Our model achieves 87% accuracy
   - Evidence: data/results.csv (column: accuracy)
   - Figure: figures/accuracy_plot.png
   - Script: scripts/evaluate.py (lines 45-67)
```

---

### Phase 2: Manuscript Planning

**Goal**: Create a detailed outline mapping repository contents to manuscript structure.

#### Step 2.1: Generate Outline
```
Use /rrwrite-plan-manuscript to create an outline for [Target Journal]
```

**Example:**
```
"Use /rrwrite-plan-manuscript to create an outline for Bioinformatics journal"
```

**Output**: `manuscript_plan.md`
- Section-by-section breakdown
- File mappings for each claim
- Word count guidance
- Journal-specific structure

#### Step 2.2: Review Outline (Optional but Recommended)
```
Use /rrwrite-review-manuscript to review the outline in manuscript_plan.md
```

**Checks:**
- Logical flow
- Evidence mapping
- Missing sections
- Journal compliance

**Output**: `review_outline.md`

#### Step 2.3: Refine Outline
- Address review feedback
- Adjust section organization
- Verify file mappings

---

### Phase 3: Literature Research

**Goal**: Conduct comprehensive literature research and document evidence.

#### Step 3.1: Research Background and Related Work
```
Use /rrwrite-research-literature to find relevant papers for my [topic] manuscript
```

**Example:**
```
"Use /rrwrite-research-literature for transformer-based protein structure prediction"
```

**What happens:**
1. Extracts topics from CLUEWRITE.md and manuscript_plan.md
2. Web search for foundational papers (pre-2020)
3. Web search for recent advances (2024-2026)
4. Web search for competing methods
5. Collects DOIs for all papers
6. Extracts direct quotes from each paper

**Outputs:**
- `rrwrite-drafts/literature_review.md` (structured summary, ~1000 words)
- `bib_additions.bib` (BibTeX entries with DOIs)
- `literature_evidence.csv` (DOIs + direct quotes)
- `literature_integration_notes.md` (where to cite)

#### Step 3.2: Review Literature Coverage
```
Use /rrwrite-review-manuscript to review the literature review in rrwrite-drafts/literature_review.md
```

**Checks:**
- Coverage completeness (foundational, related, recent)
- Citation accuracy
- Balance across approaches
- Integration guidance quality

**Output**: `review_literature.md`

#### Step 3.3: Integrate Citations
- Append `bib_additions.bib` to `references.bib`
- Note key citations for each section
- Keep `literature_evidence.csv` for verification

---

### Phase 4: Manuscript Drafting

**Goal**: Write manuscript sections with verified facts and proper citations.

#### Step 4.1: Draft Individual Sections

**Order suggestion:**
1. Methods (most straightforward, based on code)
2. Results (based on data files)
3. Introduction (now informed by literature review)
4. Discussion (synthesizes everything)
5. Abstract (last, summarizes complete manuscript)

**For each section:**
```
Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the [Section Name] section
```

**Examples:**
```
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the Methods section"
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the Results section"
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the Introduction section"
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the Discussion section"
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to write the Abstract"
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads relevant files from manuscript_plan.md
2. Reads citations from bib_index.md or references.bib
3. Generates text with proper formatting
4. **Verifies numerical claims** using rrwrite-verify-stats.py
5. Saves to `rrwrite-drafts/[section_name].md`

#### Step 4.2: Verify Numerical Claims (Critical!)

After drafting, manually verify key claims:
```bash
# Check a specific statistic
python scripts/rrwrite-verify-stats.py \
  --file data/results.csv \
  --col accuracy \
  --op mean

# Expected output matches manuscript claim
```

#### Step 4.3: Cross-Reference with Evidence File

Check interpretations of prior work:
```bash
# Compare your description of AlphaFold2 with evidence
grep "alphafold2021" literature_evidence.csv

# Ensure your manuscript accurately represents the quote
```

### Phase 5: Manuscript Review

**Goal**: Identify issues and ensure journal compliance.

#### Step 5.1: Review Complete Draft
```
Use /rrwrite-review-manuscript to review the complete manuscript draft
```

**Point to main manuscript file or specify sections:**
```
"Use /rrwrite-review-manuscript to review rrwrite-drafts/full_manuscript.md"
```

**Checks:**
- Technical accuracy
- Journal-specific requirements
- Citation integrity
- Figure references
- Data availability statements
- Word counts

**Output**: `review_manuscript_round_1.md`

#### Step 5.2: Address Review Feedback

Work through review report systematically:
- **Major Issues**: Address first (scientific gaps, missing data)
- **Minor Issues**: Fix formatting, typos, style
- **Action Items**: Specific fixes for each section

**Revise sections:**
```
"Use /rrwrite-draft-section to revise the Methods section addressing [specific issue]"
```

#### Step 5.3: Iterate
- Review → Revise → Review again
- Continue until "Accept with minor revisions"

---

### Phase 6: Final Assembly

**Goal**: Compile manuscript and prepare for submission.

#### Step 6.1: Combine Sections
```bash
# Manually combine all sections
cat rrwrite-drafts/abstract.md \
    rrwrite-drafts/introduction.md \
    rrwrite-drafts/methods.md \
    rrwrite-drafts/results.md \
    rrwrite-drafts/discussion.md \
    > rrwrite-drafts/full_manuscript.md
```

#### Step 6.2: Compile to PDF (Optional)

Using Pandoc (if installed):
```bash
pandoc rrwrite-drafts/full_manuscript.md \
  -o manuscript.pdf \
  --bibliography references.bib \
  --csl styles/[journal].csl \
  --filter pandoc-crossref
```

**Journal CSL files:**
- Nature Methods: `nature.csl`
- PLOS Computational Biology: `plos-computational-biology.csl`
- Bioinformatics: `bioinformatics.csl`

#### Step 6.3: Final Checks
- [ ] All figures referenced
- [ ] All citations in references.bib
- [ ] Data availability statement included
- [ ] Author contributions listed
- [ ] Acknowledgments added
- [ ] Supplementary materials prepared (if needed)

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before You Start
- ✅ Organize your data files with clear column names
- ✅ Document your scripts with comments
- ✅ Name figures descriptively
- ✅ Keep a references.bib file updated

### During Planning
- ✅ Be specific in CLUEWRITE.md about key findings
- ✅ Link every claim to a data file
- ✅ Review outline before drafting

### During Literature Research
- ✅ Verify all DOIs resolve
- ✅ Check evidence quotes are accurate
- ✅ Note gaps your work addresses

### During Drafting
- ✅ Draft one section at a time
- ✅ Verify every number with rrwrite-verify-stats.py
- ✅ Use exact citation keys from references.bib

### During Review
- ✅ Address major issues before minor ones
- ✅ Iterate until review says "accept with minor revisions"
- ✅ Keep evidence.csv handy for verification

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Drafting before planning (leads to poor structure)
- ❌ Skipping literature research (weak positioning)
- ❌ Not verifying numbers (risk of errors)
- ❌ Ignoring review feedback (quality suffers)
- ❌ Combining sections too early (harder to revise)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Skills not found"
```bash
# Check global installation
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/

# Re-install if needed
cd /path/to/repo-research-writer
./install.sh global
```

### "Verification script fails"
```bash
# Check data file exists
ls data/results.csv

# Check column name
head -1 data/results.csv

# Install pandas if missing
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

### "Citations not found"
```bash
# Check references.bib exists
ls references.bib

# Check citation key format
grep "alphafold2021" references.bib
```

### "Review finds many issues"
- Review the outline first (catch structure issues early)
- Verify data → claim links in CLUEWRITE.md
- Check evidence.csv quotes match your interpretations
